# Forgot-H1-Login
This web challenge was dedicated to one of VishwaCTFâ€™s sponsors, HackerOne.

We explored the website for quite some time but initially found nothing useful. Shifting our focus to the OTP functionality, I first attempted using my Gmail account to receive an OTP, but it wasnâ€™t accepted. Then, we tried an email discovered during our initial reconnaissance: ark.dev@hackerone.com. However, there was no way to retrieve the OTPâ€”until we had an idea: modifying the request to append another email address after the HackerOne email.

And just like thatâ€”voilÃ ! We received the OTP! ðŸŽ‰ But our excitement was short-lived, as the OTP wasn't being accepted. ðŸ˜ž

After some trial and error, we decided to inspect the email's source code. Thatâ€™s when we found itâ€”the flag was hidden in the X-CTF-Secrets header!

While it was satisfying to solve the challenge, I couldnâ€™t help but feel a little disappointed that it ended so abruptly. I had expected to exploit the site further after obtaining the OTP. Nonetheless, it was a fun and interesting challenge!
